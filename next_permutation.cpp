// a permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order
// e.g. for [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], ... n!
// so basically all possibilities

// the next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its 
// integer. If all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical
// order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container
// if such an arrangement is not possible, then array must be rearranged as lowest possible order (sorted in 
// ascending order)
// e.g. [1,2,3] -> [1,3,2]
// [2,3,1] -> [3,1,2]
// [3,2,1] -> [1,2,3]

// lexicographical order??

// given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums
// replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory

// constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
